# iONKiD
current version: 1.5-SNAPSHOT | 05/25/20

This repository is a part of education process in *IoT @ LP NU, 2019-2020*.

IONKiD is a student project aiming to improve communication between:
- a **doctor** specializing in developmental disorder,
- a **therapist**, who is often a parent of a child with disorder.

It consists of:
- a *[mobile app]* for the therapist to help them communicate with their doctor and get treatment-related tasks or pieces of advice, 
- and a *website* for the doctor to store information on their patients, contact the therapists, and send them treatment programs.

This repository is a store for the website. [Click here] to view our old repository that we were using during the 1st term.

***
# Core functionality

The website will allow a doctor to:
- have their own online medical portfolio,
- post the treatment program for a specific patient,
- save the program as a template to use later,
- monitor the kidâ€™s progress,
- get a real-time graph of data collected from Mi Band of a patient,
- receive a comment with explanations from the therapist in case the kid cannot complete the task,
- access the private dialogue with the therapist,
- search for patients that do not have a leading doctor yet,
- set up your profile data and notifications,
- access the forum for the doctors to share their experience and help each other.
